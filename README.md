Bubbleland Metaphor Program Sources
This project is used to provide readers of the book "The Metaphor of the Bubbleland" with the codes of the programs used to generate some of the images in the book.
The user must understand the Python programming language. The programs were written and tested in Python version 3.9.
Questions can be sent by email (ferraoneto<at>gmai.com) to Antonio Ferrao Neto. ("<at>" means "@").
This project is maintained by the author of the book.
